(defn upsert-file-in-parts
  "Uploads a file to S3 in parts.

  Given `aws-s3-client`, `key` and a function `upload-parts-fn` uploads
  the file constructed by parts created by `upload-parts-fn` to S3.

  Does not abort failed multipart uploads. The cleaning of failed multipart
  uploads depends on the S3 bucket's policy.

  Parameters:
  - aws-s3-client: The AWS S3 Client.
  - key (string): The location inside the bucket.
  - upload-parts-fn (fn [(fn [byte-array -> nil]) -> nil]): A function that
      is provided the function to upload a single part. All the uploaded parts
      (except the last one) should be >=5MB.

  Returns:
  - nil

  Example:
  (upsert-file-in-parts
    (user/aws-s3-client)
    \"foo/bar/baz.txt\"
    (fn [upload-part]
           ;; Uploading a part of size 5MB (the minimum requirement).
           (upload-part (byte-array (repeatedly (* 5 1024 1024) #(rand-int 256))))
           ;; The last part can be less than 5MB.
